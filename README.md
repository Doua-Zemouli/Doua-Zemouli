## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-Mathematician turned Data Analyst\Scientist. Here is a summary of my journey:  
*Started as a Mathematician   
*Bsc and Master in Mathematics (valedictorian) as well as PhD in Stocastic differential equations (Probability, statistics and Analysis)  
*Became a Math teacher for over 4 years and got incredibly sick of hearing students say "In real life, what is math used for anyway?"  
*Transitioned into Data Analytics\Science to show how a strong mathematical backround can help you solve problems, understand or optimise model performance, and interpret complex data that answer relevant questions. 

-Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter, BeautifulSoup, MySQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Matlab, Latex.  
-Languages: Arabic (Native), English (Fluent), French (Fluent), Korean (B1) and German (A2).
